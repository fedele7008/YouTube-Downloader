# External Libraries

This project uses the following external libraries:
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/): A software for audio and video processing.

This directory is empty initially, and the external libraries needed to be installed through
`python scripts/download_dependencies.py` from the root directory of the project.

Note that prior to running `download_dependencies.py`, you need to install required packages in
`requirements.txt`.

Thus if you haven't so, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the root directory of the project first.

We recommend using virtual environment to manage dependencies.
